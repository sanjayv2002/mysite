      `I've been developing AI - applications since 2020. I wasn't aware of the full realm of data science at the beginning. It was just python, kaggle and notebooks land for me`,
      `After learning Deep Learning and punching my way through building Models, I managed to understand why things were the way they were. So with more hassle, I learned to build pipelines and web-based-AI applications. Participated in hackathons, Completed certifications and much much more, which i dont' happen to remember while writing this.`,
      `But now, I'm getting Better. I've been coding in R, React, Python, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Electron, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++ to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I know, I'm hilarious.`,
